     * An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly "first in, first
     * out" basis. People mush adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals
     * at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will
     * receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they
     * would like. Create the data structure to maintain this system and implement operations
     * such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and dequeueCat. You may
     * use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
