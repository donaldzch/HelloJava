     * An array A contains all the integers from 0 through n, except for one number which is
     * missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation.
     * The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use
     * to access them is "fetch and jth bit of A[i]," which takes constant time. Write code to
     * find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?
