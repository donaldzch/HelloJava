     * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
     * pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible
     * by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course,
     * can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function
     * drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y) which draws a horizontal
     * line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
